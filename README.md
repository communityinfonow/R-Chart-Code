# R-Chart-Code
The purpose of this repository is to provide guidance on running code in R to create charts. This repository includes two files: "Chart_Template_GitHub.Rmd" which is an RMarkdown file that includes code to create charts, and "Datasheet Template_GitHub.xlsx" which is an Excel Sheet template that shows you how to format the data in Google Sheets to run the R code. The code explains how to connect R to your google account so that the code can run.

This code can be used as a template to create different types of charts for reports and other projects. Be sure to read notes carefully. Once you start running actual chart chunks, run the whole chunk everytime by clicking  the arrow at the top right of the chunk or pressing Ctrl + Shift + Enter when the cursor is anywhere inside the chunk.
