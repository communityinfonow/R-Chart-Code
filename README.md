# R-Chart-Code
This code can be used as a template to create different types of charts for reports and other projects. Be sure to read notes carefully. Once you start running actual chart chunks, run the whole chunk everytime by clicking  the arrow at the top right of the chunk or pressing Ctrl + Shift + Enter when the cursor is anywhere inside the chunk. 
For more resources on understanding how ggplot works you can review the following literature:

Included in this repository is a Datasheet template. The data needs to be formatted the same as the template in Google Sheets for this code to run and create charts. The code explains how to connect R to your google account so that the code can run.
