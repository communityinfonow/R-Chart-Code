# R-Chart-Code
This code can be used as a template to create different types of charts for reports and other projects. Be sure to read notes carefully. Once you start running actual chart chunks, run the whole chunk everytime by clicking  the arrow at the top right of the chunk or pressing Ctrl + Shift + Enter when the cursor is anywhere inside the chunk.
